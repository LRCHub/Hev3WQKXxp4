Life no more fits me, death a fashion crime
Life is but one space in time
Honey come home
Control your mind it knows not right from wrong
I've been here for way too long
Honey come home
I saw their eyes that witness godless nights
Light's a mockery of sight
Honey come home
I search the sky I look for higher ground
Heaven's only one way down
Honey come home
Conceal your sex appeal
Evacuate
Mind the highway interstate
Honey I'm home
Life no more miss me, death the final high
Life is just one way to die
Honey come home
I never got to know all the phantoms on my way home
