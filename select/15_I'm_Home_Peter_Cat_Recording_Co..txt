I'm coming
To see you today
So long after words
I'm coming to see you today
I'm trying to be first
I'm winning
To be here today
Who cares if it fails
So long as it sails
I'm Home
Home
For good

I'm coming
To see you today
You planted a worm
I'm killing
To see you today
Who cares if it fades
Who cares if it stains
Who watches and waits
Who's pushed to the brink
I'm home
Home
For good
